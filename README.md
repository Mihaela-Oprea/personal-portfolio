# 💻 My Portfolio Website

This **responsive portfolio website** was developed to present my work and skills as a **Frontend Developer**. I built this project from scratch by following a tutorial by **Bedimcode** on YouTube, which helped me learn and apply modern web development practices. The project is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, with a focus on clean design, smooth navigation, and interactive elements.
